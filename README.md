# HostelDK - web application for accommodation booking

## Overview
HostelDK is a platform where users can create an account and book a stay in a selected room. Users have access to room descriptions, features, a map with the location, and a calendar showing available dates. After payment, users can also access their invoice. The administrator has access to statistics and various management options within the application.

With this project, I aimed to focus more on practicing Next.js with TypeScript and advanced global state management using Redux. It's also my larger project utilizing MongoDB as the database and an integrated Stripe payment gateway. The application is responsive. Additionally, uploaded images are hosted on the Cloudinary cloud, and user authentication is done using NextAuth.js. In the application, I've also integrated a map preview using Mapbox. As for the design, I drew inspiration from another available website to save some time in this area, as design wasn't the main focus of learning here.
